## Lichess BOT Creator ##

Wanna make a lichess bot, but dunno how to make this? Using my program you can easily create lichess bot. Lets start!

## Requirements ##

**art**

**colorama**

**berserk**

To import this libraries you need to write this code in **Terminal**:

`pip install art`

`pip install berserk` 

`pip install colorama`

## Start ##

Run **makebot.py**

After this if you want to create bot write 1, or if you want see the BOTs which our script made, write 2.

Okay, let's say you write 1.

Then give me your API Token. [Where we can get token?](https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token)

After that, if in console was writing **'Done!'** the BOT is created. If in console was writing **'no such token'** that means, that Token which you gave isnt correct.
